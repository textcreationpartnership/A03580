            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The Staffe may be vsed to diuerse purposes: but my chiefest end and intention therein, is to take the height of the Sunne aboue the <hi>Horizon.</hi>

                     <p>Comparisons are odious, therefore I omit that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and request you to propound some other question. Yet this I say, that this Staffe is not so troublesome as that, which you haue named. Moreouer, the degr√©es thereof are greater then those of the other Staffe, though the Staues themselues be of equall length. For <hi>5.</hi> of them are as bigge as <hi>15.</hi> in the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Stella.</hi> Neither are you tied vnto an <hi>Horizon:</hi> for it may be vsed both by land and sea: and without applying it vnto your sight.</p>

                     <p>These be no small commodities. If therefore I may

                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>First therefore, what names doe you giue vnto these two p√©eces of wood?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>I call the one the Yard, the other the Transame.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>What meane these markes that are in them?</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>They are degrees of altitude, with their minutes.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>But how shall I distinguish the Transame from the Yard, seeing the degrees in them both be all of one quantitie, neither hath the one of them any more degrees then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true that there be <hi>45.</hi> degrees in each of them. The Transame containeth the first, namely, all the degrees from <hi>1.</hi> to <hi>45:</hi> the Yard containeth the rest, namely, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from <hi>45.</hi> vnto <hi>90.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Is that of necessitie that they should do so?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>No: But by this meane I make the degrees so great as they are.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Then I perceiue this: that <hi>from the rysing of the Sunne, vntill he be raysed 45. degrees aboue the Horizon, his eleuation must be taken in the Transame.</hi> Againe, <hi>after that he is 45. degrees aboue the Horizon, his eleuation must be taken in the Yard.</hi>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so.</p>

                     <p>Yea: For this is a generall rule, that <hi>whether you apply it vnto your eye, or whether you holde it in your hand, the Transame must be alwaies perpendicular vnto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and the yarde leuell vnto the same.</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:15647:5"/>it is enough: But vpon the Lande, or looking out at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of an house, or standing in the str√©ete, you may adioyne vnto the one side of your Transame a Plummet of Leade, thereby to finde out his perpendicularitie.

                     <p>This one thing is not to be neglected, that it must stand on the ball of your ch√©eke, for that place is most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, because it doth not lightly y√©elde, neither is the sight thereby distorted: Yet if any man thinke it m√©eter to apply the Staffe to the corner of his eie next to the eare, I will not gainesay him, because the sight is not to euery man so ready in one place as it is in an other.</p>

                     <p>Let this be your rule: <hi>Keepe the degrees of the Yard vpward, and let the degrees of the Transame be toward you, so shall you be the lesse deceiued.</hi> Otherwise to them that are cunning, it is neither here nor there.</p>

                     <p>This is to be noted, that <hi>the edge of the Vane must be placed iust with the highest degree of the Transame.</hi>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>First, <hi>you must know whether the Sunne bee more or lesse then 45. degrees aboue the Horizon.</hi>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It is most easie. The Transam and the yard being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, as you haue b√©ene taught: turne the <hi>90.</hi> degrees of the yard toward your breast (it is no matter for setting it vnto your eie) and bring the Transame right against the Sunne, vntill the shadowe thereof fall euen with the side of the yard. <hi>If the shadow of the Transame from the toppe of the Vane downward be longer then the yard, it is a most certaine signe that the Sunne is under 45. degrees high.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Set the Staffe close to your eye, k√©eping the yard par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallele vnto the <hi>Horizon,</hi> as you haue beene taught before: then let the Transame sinke downe into his socket, vntill the toppe of the Vane come euen with the Centre of the Sunns, the number of the degr√©es from the top of the vane to the notch of the Socket will declare his eleuation.</p>

                     <p>It may be found out otherwise in this manner: Put that end of the Transame into his Socket, which contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the beginning of the degr√©es, let the first degr√©e come euen with the notch, as the <hi>45.</hi> degr√©e did before, and make the Transame fast with the scrue: then set the yard vnto your eie, and k√©eping it leuel, moue the Vane vp and downe, vntill the vppermost edge thereof come euen with the Centre of the

                     <p>The Yard, Transame, and Vane being orderly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as it was taught before, set the yard vnto your eie, and k√©eping it leuel, draw the Transame to you ward, vntill the Vane be euen with the Centre of the Sunne: the degr√©e then of the yard, vpon which the notch of the socket lighteth, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto you the height of the Sunne.</p>

You may also take the distaunces of any two starres thereby, so that they be not further asunder then <hi>90.</hi> degr√©es, following the selfe same precepts which you haue bene taught concerning the Sunnƒìs altitude. For if the two stars be lesse then <hi>45.</hi> degr√©es asunder, they will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the end of the Transame, and the yard. Then set the yard against the one starre, and draw the Transame into his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, vntill the edge of the Vane light vpon the other star, and the degrees of the Transame will shew their distaunce. If the two starres propounded he more, then <hi>45.</hi> degr√©es asunder, it is certaine, that they will he without the compasse of the Transame. Then draw the Transame towarde your sight, vntill the end of the yard light vpon the one starre, and the edge of the Vane vppon the other starre, and the degrees of the yard will shew their distaunce, so that you may take the
<pb facs="tcp:15647:7"/>distance of any two starres that are <hi>90.</hi> degr√©es asunder.</p>

                     <p>Now let vs returne vnto the former question: how must the Transame and the Yard be ioyned together, and how must the Vane be placed, if I be not disposed to set the staffe vnto mine eie?</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>The ioyning of them, is after diuerse maners, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the vse doth differ. First, you may find the sunnes ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in the same maner, as you did before, although you do not apply the staffe vnto your eie, and therefore in this case the Transame and the Yard must be ioyned together, as they were before, and the Vane must also stand after the same manner.</p>

                     <p>Set the palme of your hand close to the end of the Yard where the <hi>90.</hi> degr√©e is placed, and then turne the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same vpon the Sunne, and pull downe the Transame into the socket, vntill the shadow of the toppe of the Vane fall iust vppon the end of the Yard close to your hand: Then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gr√©e of the Transame next vnto the socket, is the Sunnes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuation.</p>

                     <p>Yea, euen as you did before. For this is all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that your hand standeth now in stead of your eie And I am of this minde, that if you take h√©ede vnto the leuell of your yard, you may take the Sunne as precisely this way, as you do with applying the staffe vnioy our ete.

                     <p>There is yet an other way to finde out the height of the Sunne without setting the staffe vnto your eie. For the performaunce of which conclusion, you must set the yard and the Transame together thus.

                     <p>You must here also haue that consideration which you had before of the Suns eleuation, whether he be more or lesse then <hi>45.</hi> degr√©es, which is knowen by the rule giuen in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it materiall which side of the shadow I do choose?</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, For that side of the shadow must be chosen, which is made by that part of the Vane, which is next vnto the end of the yard, as you may s√©e in the figure.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Then must the Transame lie leuell with the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi> which before did hang perpendicular, and the yard must stand vpright toward your Zenith.

                     <p>No: By reason their beame is so weake that it cannot cast a shadow; but the beame of the sunne being so strong, his height may thus be easily found out, and very readily, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so certainely, hauing onely this care, that the staffe be kept le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell as it ought to be.</p>

                     <p>It may be vsed to diuerse other purposes (as I said in the beginning:) namely, to the description of Regions, and Countries: to the finding out of the quantities of the Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone: with the longitude and latitude of the Planets. This staffe also serueth to the correcting of the places of the fixed stars: &amp; to the setting downe of the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the rising or setting of the Sunne or Stars. But mine intent was onely to take the Sunnes eleuation therwith. Yet haue I told you how to take the altitude of the stars with their distances, by the same staffe: which for this time shall suffice. The other propositions I will lay forth, either in my publike lectures which I read, or at other more conuenient time, as my leysure serueth.</p>

                     <p>I know not that: but they take occasion to call it so, by reason of those wordes which are written <hi>Gen. 32.10.</hi> where the Patriarch sayth, <hi>That with his Staffe he came ouer Iordane:</hi> Wherein I thinke, they misconstrue his meaning.

                     <p>First, as in the other Staffe, the degr√©es of the Yard and Transame are all one in number, so are the partitions in this. Secondly, as the yard and Transame in that, did ioyne together squarewise and at right angles, so must they doe in this. Thirdly, there must the same consideration be had in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Vane in this, that was had in the placing of the Vane in the other: that is, it must stand euen with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the partitions, except some speciall occasion require o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, as is to be s√©ene in the measuring of breadthes. Fourthly, <hi>One of the two, either the Yard or the Transame, as occasion serueth, must be parallele vnto the thing measured, the other must be perpendicular.</hi>

                     <p>Then haue I b√©ene amisse informed, as I haue s√©ene men, that haue thought them selues to be of no small cunning in the vse of the Staffe, who measuring the height of a thing, haue made no matter how they held their Staffe, so that they did s√©e the toppe and the bottome of the thing to be measured, euen with the two ends of their Transame.</p>

                     <p>Belaeue me in this, that it cannot be that their practise should be true. This one argument shall serue for a thousand. You know that the proofe of the vse of the Iacobs staffe stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vppon the proportion of Triangles.

                     <p>Your reason is good that it shoulde be so: but me thinketh that the perfourmaunce thereof should bee impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>

                     <p>You know that many Fields be full of Dales and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low places: others be full of Hilles and Mountaines. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, many things stand not vpright vpon the ground, but leane either forward or backeward, or else to the one side or to the other. Last of all in the bredth of a thing there is a great variety. For be it in a wall, or fielde, or what else whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, there is for the most part either hollownesse or round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or some such like thing which may make it impossible in my iudgement to draw either parallele or perpendicular line vnto them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>I graunt those things to bee as you say: yet doe they not hinder a man from taking the measure of their length, height, or breadth. For where the place it selfe doeth not affoorde a leuelnesse: it is an easie matter to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine it leuell. Thus also you must thinke with your selfe, that although Geometry b√©e the Arte of measuring well, and generally nothing may be excluded from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe thereof, yet must we not bee too curious in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, least we shew our selues either ouer wise, or else too foolish. The Phisitian generally professeth to heale all disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but when he commeth to deale with particular bodies, he faileth in his art, and yet is not to be discommended so long as he doeth that which Art requireth. It is enough for the Geometrician, if he giue the iust length of a streight line drawen betweene two places assigned. Or if hee can not doe it by one streight line, he may doe it by many. Whosoeuer immediately (for mediately he may finde out the length of a crooked line by meanes of a straight line)
<pb facs="tcp:15647:12"/>whosoeuer, I say, requireth any more of him then that, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buseth both the man and the art. Therefore, when any thing is propounded to be measured, be it length, height, or breadth, you are first of all to consider, whether the thing lie leuell, or stand vpright, or be straight, as it is required that it should be. If it be straight, you may presently fall in hand to measure it, as your rule shall direct you: If it be not straight, but be either crooked, or leaning one way or another, it must be your principall care, first to fit the same to your purpose: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in measuring the distance of a thing (for I will first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with that dimension, and will afterwards teach you what you shall doe in the rest) if the distaunce betw√©ene two places assigned be not straight, as you s√©e in these figures which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it is not, then choose out two points in the distance, the one being at the one end thereof, and the other in the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tw√©ene which you may imagine a right line to be drawen, and then so hold your Staffe, that the yard or the Transame may be parallele, or perpendicular vnto it, as occasion shall serue.</p>

                     <p>First, <hi>that whether the Yard or the Transame be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto your sight, it must stand close vnto the ball of your cheeke.</hi>

                  <sp>

                     <p>That which hath the beginning of the degr√©es: for so it is most conuenient for the readinesse of your account. The second note is this: <hi>to winke with one eie.</hi> For the sight by that meanes will aime at your marke the better, when it is not parted but brought into one. The third obseruation is this: that, <hi>the distance of your marke be not ouer great.</hi>

                     <p>Why do you giue this note, considering that in the vse of the other Staffe, there was no limitation made of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance? For you measured therewith the starres in heauen.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>The case is not all one, because the Starres haue a brightnesse which helpeth their sight, and their beame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth directly from the Centre of their body, vnto our eye. But in terrestriall things it is not so: For in them, by reason of the weakenesse of our sight, we may be greatly deceiued, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be within a reasonable compasse.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>What do you call a reasonable compasse, or distance?</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It cannot well be defined, because there are so many things required therein, that they will hardly iumpe all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally: as these, the clearenesse of the aire: the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:15647:13"/>of the sight: the largenesse of the instrument. The aire may be cleare, but the sight of a man may be dull.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, both the aire and sight may serue the turne, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument which he is to vse may be so small, that he can not take any thing farre distant from him.

                     <p>Thus: You know this, that either you stand vpright, or else leane one way or other.

                     <p>These fiue things you say are generally to be noted. <hi>1. The setting of the Saffe at the ball of the eye: 2. The wincking with one eie: 3. A reasonable distance: 4.

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea: The length, and the height, are found out thr√©e seuerall waies, and the breadth two waies. The first and the second way require one station: the last way in each dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is performed by two stations.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>A station is nothing else but the place wherein you
<pb facs="tcp:15647:13"/>stand: to performe a thing therefore at one station, is nothing else but by a standing in one onely place by the helpe of your instrument, to take the measure of a thing. To performe it at two stations, is by standing in two seuerall places to take your measure.</p>

                     <p>What generall note is there to be obserued, when we measure a thing at one station?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>You know this, that the measuring of a thing by the Iacobs Staffe, dependeth wholly vpon proportions, whose drift and finall end is this, by thr√©e numbers giuen, to find out the fourth. Two of these numbers are alwaies the partes of your Staffe, the one being the partes of your Transame, the other of the yard: the which numbers must be placed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the rules which follow shall direct you. The thirde number of proportion is some assigned measure in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If you measure the length of a thing, some certaine height must be assigned. If you measure the height or breadth of a thing, some certaine length, or distance must be giuen you for your thirde proportionall number, and this number must k√©epe the third place in the rule of proportion, or Golden rule, or rule of thr√©e, as we do commonly terme it. Then must we say thus: that, <hi>as the partes of the Transame cutte off by the Yard, are vnto the parts of the Yard cut off by the Transame:</hi> Or contrariwise: <hi>As the parts of the yard cut off by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same, are vnto the parts of the Transame cut off by the yard, so is the assigned measure which is giuen you, vnto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the thing sought for.</hi> This is the chiefest note in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring at one station.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>There are thr√©e things specially to be noted: The first is, <hi>the making of your stations, that they be both of them in a right line with the thing to the which you leuell your staffe, whether you go forward or backward.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Choose out some marke in the thing to be measured, which may be leuell with your eye, then set vp two staues where you minde to make your two stations, so that standing at the further Staffe, you may bring the other iust with the marke which you doe choose out: so shall you be sure that the two stations are in a right line with the marke chosen. For it is a generall rule, that <hi>if three pointes be in one leuell of the eye, those three pointes are in one right line.</hi> The second is, <hi>that your eye be no higher at the one station then it is at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> This is to be done by the rule which I gaue you euen now For if you, standing at your second station, and holding your Staffe leuell from your sight, can s√©e the top of the Staffe which standeth at your first station, and also the marke which you choose, it is a certaine signe that your eye is in his iust height. The third note is, <hi>that the distuance betweene the two stations be diligently taken, and that in a right line, so neare as is possible:</hi> because the whole art of measuring by the Iacobs staffe, dependeth vpon a right line. This distance must be the third number of your proportion. And these be the chiefest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations that I remember. If there be any thing else, I will put you in minde thereof as occasion serueth.</p>

                     <p>It is the distaunce betw√©ene the place whereon you stand, and the place assigned, vnto which you direct your sight: and in this case we commonly say thus: How farre is it from my foote, to such or such a thing? as a Tr√©e or House. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>The first rule requireth, <hi>that the yard should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the length measured:</hi> And that is this. <hi>The yard of your Staffe being perpendicular vnto the thing measured.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>That is generally called the end of the Transame, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the which your eie sight passeth wheresoeuer it be, whether it be in the very end of the wood it selfe, or any other place, where you list to set the Vane, so that your eye sight passe by that place.</p>

                     <p>The height of the measure is the distaunce betw√©ene the top of the Staffe and the thing measured: as in the 1. figure from y. to o. and from a. to o. is the height of the measurer: so that whether he stand vppon the ground at the one end of the distance assigned, or whether he stand vpon some higher place, the maner of worke is all one: this being noted as a generall rule: <hi>That the height of the top of the yard from the ground, must be certainely knowen.</hi>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Put case the partes of the Yard cut off by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same bee <hi>60.</hi> and the partes of the Transame cut off by the Yard be <hi>180.</hi> let the height of the Staffe from the ground be <hi>4.</hi> foote: then I say that as <hi>60.</hi> which are the partes of the Yard, are vnto <hi>180.</hi> which are the parts of the Transame: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so is <hi>4.</hi> f√©ete, which is the supposed height of him that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth vnto the length propounded. So that I conclude the length thereof to be <hi>12.</hi> foote.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>This is easily concluded, and dependeth, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vpon the <hi>4.</hi> p. of the <hi>6.</hi> booke of <hi>Euclide:</hi> where it is sayed that: <hi>In equiangle triangles, the sides which containe the equall Angles are proportionall, and the sides which are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:15647:15"/>vnder the equall Angles, are of like proportion.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I perceiue (as you told me before) that the third number of the proportion, is the assigned height.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true: and you may most manifestly perceiue that in the Figure which you sayd concerning <hi>Euclides</hi> propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For the <hi>2.</hi> Triangles a. e. i. and a. o. u. are like, because they are situated after one and the selfe same maner: therfore in the Triangle a. e. i. as a. e. is vnto a. i. so in the Triangle a. o. u. a. o. is vnto o. u. Thus you s√©e the commodity of the Staffe in measuring the length of a thing. And here you must note this, <hi>That it is no matter whether the thing measured do lie in a plaine or flat, or whether it be in the ascention or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of an Hill, or whether there be any concauity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uexity betweene the ends of the thing measured.</hi> So that by this rule, we may measure the breadth of any Riuer, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Trench, or of any Valley betw√©ene the tops of the hils, or the distaunce of two Ships at sea &amp;c.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>The first Rule required, that the yard should be perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular vnto the thing measured. Put case the yard do lie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallele vnto it, as it is in the <hi>2.</hi> Figure, what then?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The yard being parallele vnto the thing measured, if your sight passe from the beginning of the yard ouer the ende of the Transame, then, as the parts of the Transame cut off by the yard, are vnto the parts of the yard cut off by the Transam, so is the height assigned vnto the length propounded to bee measured.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>So then by your Rule I conclude, that if the partes of the Transame cut off by the yard be <hi>120.</hi> parts: and the parts of the yard cut off by the Transame be <hi>210.</hi> and the height as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed and knowen be <hi>400.</hi> f√©ete, the length to be measured must be <hi>700.</hi> f√©ete, as I perceiue by the Golden rule, and by the proposition of <hi>Euclide</hi> mentioned before.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>You say very true: for considering the two Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles a. u. o. and a. i. e. are like, it must n√©edes follow, that as in the lesser Triangle o. u. is vnto u. a: so in the greater e. i.
<pb facs="tcp:15647:15"/>must be vnto i. a.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>You sayd heretofore, that there were <hi>3.</hi> waies to finde out the length of any thing, whereof <hi>2.</hi> are already set downe: What is the third way?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>The two waies already set downe, require but one station. For you are not bound to remoue from the place whereon you first set your foot when you beginne to measure. But this third way requireth a double station, as in the <hi>3.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which is many times necessary, because that a Tr√©e, or a Wall, or an Hill, may be betw√©ene our sight and the end of the thing, whose distaunce from vs we desire to know, so that our sight cannot come vnto the end thereof. The third way dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the former in this, that there is no altitude to be assigned and giuen for the third number of the proportion, but the third number of the proportion, is the distaunce betw√©ene the two stations.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>I pray you answere me to this: Considering that I must take <hi>2.</hi> stations, at which is it best to begin? Is it best to begin my first station at the end of the distance propounded, and so go backeward? or is it best to begin my first station a good way from the end of the distaunce propounded, and then come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to make my second station?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>That is neither here nor there: But the common vse is to begin the first station, at the end of the distance propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and so go backward: in the which thing doing, you must take h√©ede of that especially, which I told you before, <hi>that you goe backeward in a straight line:</hi> so that the line imagined to be drawen from the one end of the distance propounded vnto the other, being continued vnto the second station must make but one right line: otherwise you shall erre in your measure more or lesse.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>What distaunce is best to be made betw√©ene the two stations?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>The larger the better: For it is good neuer to take a short station, if you may haue a large one: because your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb facs="tcp:15647:16"/>will be the lesse thereby.</p>

                     <p>In this kinde of measuring, must the Transame k√©epe one place vpon the yard, without pulling it nigher, or putting it farther off from the sight?</p>

                     <p>Put case that at your first station the partes of the Transame cut off by the Yard were <hi>108.</hi> at your second stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, put case the partes of the Transame cut off by the Yard were <hi>72.</hi> imagine also the distance betw√©ene your two stations were <hi>40.</hi> f√©ete: I must s√©eke out the difference betw√©ene the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall partes of the Transame cut off by the Yard: which by subduction I finde to be <hi>36.</hi> (for that is the remainder, <hi>72.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subducted out of <hi>108.</hi>) whereupon I conclude thus, that as the difference of the greater segment of the Transame, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>36.</hi> is vnto the lesser segment, which is <hi>72.</hi> so is the distance betw√©ene my two stations, to the length propounded: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the length propunded to be measured is <hi>80.</hi> f√©ete.

                     <p>It is so: But you must remember to adde the height of your owne stature: so that it shall be in all <hi>16,</hi> f√©ete, or <hi>15.</hi> f√©ete

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It is all one with the measuring of heights. For the depth is nothing else but a rehearsed height. And therefore in the measuring of the depth of a thing, <hi>The Yard of your staffe being parallele vnto the side of the thing, whose depth you measure, and your sight passing from the toppe thereof: as the parts of the Transame cut off by the Yard, are to the parts of the Yard cut off by the Transame, so is the assigned length vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth of the thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceiue your meaning. As for example: If the parts of the Transame be <hi>5.</hi> and the partes of the Yard <hi>13.</hi> and the diameter of the well (which is here in this example the assg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned length) be <hi>10.</hi> f√©ete long, the depth must be <hi>26.</hi> f√©ete.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true, if you account from the top of your Staffe, and therefore that you may haue the iust depth of the thing, you must take away from the aforesaid number as much as is aboue the thing measured: which if you suppose to be one foote in length, then is the well <hi>25.</hi> foote d√©epe, as appeareth in the fifth figure.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus much by the way concerning the measuring of any depth. What other rule haue you for the measuring of heights?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>The first rule required that the Transame should be perpendicular vnto the height propounded. The second requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Yard to be perpendicular: as in the sixt figure: so that it differeth from the other onely in the manner of holding the Staffe. The rule is this: <hi>The yard of your Staffe being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular vnto the thing measured as the parts of the yard are to the parts of the Transame, so is the assigned length vnto the height propounded to be measured.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>So that I may conclude thus. If the parts of the Yard be <hi>60.</hi> and the parts of the Transame <hi>60.</hi> and the assigned length be <hi>250.</hi> f√©ete: the height propounded must also be <hi>250.</hi> f√©ete.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Your conclusion is allowable: But I must put you in minde of this, to adde the allowance of your stature, which if you suppose to be <hi>4.</hi> f√©ete, then is the whole height <hi>254.</hi> f√©ete: Now marke this one thing for your further learning.</p>

                     <p>That is according as you stand to take the measure.
<pb facs="tcp:15647:19"/>If you stand within the two ends of the thing propounded to be measured, your sight must passe by the two ends of the TrƒÅ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same.

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes: The one end of the Transame must alwaies he that, where the partitions begin: the other end is that, vppon which the Vane must stand, and by which the sight passeth. For many times it will so fall out that your sight cannot passe by both the ends of the wood, so that you shall be enforced to place the Vane in some one part or other of the Transame, that it may be a limit for your sight. And this is a generall rule, that <hi>if you stand within the ends of the breadth propounded, the one end of your Transame must be on the one side of the yard, and the other on the other side.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>No: Except your station be made accordingly. If you stand in the middest of the thing to be measured, then will the yard be iust in the middest, betw√©ene the endes of the Transame: if you stand more to the one end then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the yard also will fall out in like manner, more toward the one end of the Transame, then toward the other.</p>

                     <p>This. <hi>The Yard being perpendicular vnto the breadth assigned, as the parts of the Yard cut off by the Transame are vnto the partes of the Transame contained betweene the two ends, so is the distance betweene your feete and the thing measured, to the breadth thereof.</hi> As in the tenth figure.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It is this: <hi>The Yard being perpendicular vnto the thing measured, &amp; your sight passing by the ends of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same (as it is required:) as the difference of the two segments of the yard is vnto the distaunce betweene the two stations, so are the parts of the Transame betweene the two ends thereof, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the breadth propounded:</hi> as it is in the <hi>11.</hi> figure.</p>

                     <p>This also is very easie by reason of that which was taught before. So that I may conclude, that if the difference of the two segments in the yard be <hi>30.</hi> parts: and the distance of my two stations be <hi>40.</hi> f√©ete: and the parts betw√©ene the two ends of the Transame be <hi>50.</hi> then must the bredth of the thing be <hi>66.</hi> f√©ete and <hi>‚Öî.</hi> Haue you any other thing to be added?</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>No: But that I would haue you to practise this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and I will hereafter further you in other things.</p>

                     <p>I thanke you for it. Yet before I depart, I pray you let me aske you one question: You said before, that in measuring the breadth of any thing it is at my choise to stand where I will, either within the two ends of the thing to be measured, or against the one end thereof, or without both the endes, in
<pb facs="tcp:15647:20"/>what place I shall thinke most expedient. This last kinde of measuring me thinketh is strange (as for the other I perceiue well enough how their proportion will fall out) wherefore I pray you helpe me herein.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Set the question as you shall thinke it best for your owne vnderstanding.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Put case I were to take the breadth of a riuer, as in the <hi>12.</hi> figure, vnto whose brinke I can not come any nigher then <hi>40.</hi> f√©ete, by reason of some marish grounds adioyning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: what meanes shall I vse to finde the breadth thereof?</p>

                     <p>Put case I were to take the breadth of a riuer, as in the <hi>12.</hi> figure, vnto whose brinke I can not come any nigher then <hi>40.</hi> f√©ete, by reason of some marish grounds adioyning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: what meanes shall I vse to finde the breadth thereof?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>But how must they stand in respect of the riuer?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Ind√©ed that is a speciall thing to be noted: They must stand so, that the right line imagined to come from the two markes, may make a right angle with the riuers side: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you shall erre in taking of your measure: Because that only is accounted the breadth of a thing, which maketh a right angle with the length.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Hauing chosen out these two markes, what is then to be done?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>You must set vp another, which must stand also iust in one right line with the two first markes, whose distaunce from the mark on this side the riuer, must either be giuen you, as being already certainely knowne: or else it must be found out by the first rule concerning the measuring of breadths.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Put case I either know it, or finde it to be <hi>40.</hi> f√©ete.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>You must choose out a conuenient place, wherein you may make your station, &amp; settle your selfe about your worke.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>How must that place lie from the marke that was last set vp?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>It must lie from it so, that the line drawne from that
<pb facs="tcp:15647:20"/>marke vnto the place of your standing, may make a right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with the line drawne betweene the thr√©e afornamed markes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Must I not know the iust length betw√©ene the place wherein I make my station, and the marke which I set vp.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes: For it is the third proportionall number.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>Imagine that distance to be <hi>60.</hi> f√©ete.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Then your rule to finde out the breadth is this: <hi>The Yard being perpendicular with the marke set vp, and your sight passing from the head thereof by the end of the Transame vnto the marke standing on the farther side of the riuer, as the parts of the Yard cut off by the Transame, are vnto the partes of the Transame cut off by the Yarde: so is the distaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your station and the marke set vp vnto the distaunce betweene the sayd marke, and the marke standing vppon the further side of the riuer.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>But what is this to the question that I propounded? you make an aunswere concerning the distaunce of the two markes, whereas I moued a question of the breadth of the Riuer.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Be not angry, I will satisfie you straight waies: first finde out the distance of these two markes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>That can I easily doe: For the parts of the yard being <hi>30.</hi> and the parts of the Transame <hi>36.</hi> and the distance of my station from the first marke <hi>60.</hi> f√©ete. The first marke must be distant from the third <hi>72.</hi> f√©ete.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Then what is the breadth of the riuer?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>That must come from you, for I cannot make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Then marke this. You sayd the distaunce of the first marke from the third being on the farther side of the Riuer is <hi>72.</hi> f√©ete: and the distaunce of the first marke from the second being on the hither side of the Riuer, was graunted to be <hi>40.</hi> f√©ete: then take <hi>40.</hi> out of <hi>72.</hi> and the remainder being <hi>32.</hi> f√©ete, declareth the breadth of the Riuer.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceiue now what a commodity it is to haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor. For the thing which s√©emed vnto me most strange, and altogether impertinent to my question, is by your meanes made most evident vnto me, and greatly to the matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. But must I take this course, whensoeuer I am dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to stand without the compasse of the thing measured.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, that you must: And sometimes also you shall be driuen to the second rule, wherein two stations are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which soeuer you vse it commeth all vnto one purpose, and will eastly affoord you the breadth of a thing.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
                     <p>I can but thanke you for your paines, and good will, in accepting me for your scholler.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>And I likewise you, for making choise of me to be your maister. My will is good to helpe whom I may: howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer others may make more boast of their cunning.</p>
